This is a module for HHMM-based decoding of already given candidate segments from audio
---------------------------------


inputs: 
candSegments - read from file
URI_targetNoExt


outputs: 
 
allWeights = [];
allStartFrames = [];
allEndFrames = [];

!!! current parameters: 
initial tempoCoeff = 2
weight - according to acoustic weight
pr velocity transition = 0.2
with tempo estimation from me. not from Sertan


CODE organization
-------------------------
main function doit

decodeOneCandSegment
rankPaths - select only full paths ; calculate ranks for these selected paths 

NOTE: decodeViterbi -> if whichFrame=1


params: init prob equal to start at p=1:10; fix to start at vel v=2;  


we allow bigger transition prob, to allow change of speed to accommodate skipping or  insertion of phonemes relative to phoneme transcipt
